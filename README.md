# Elevator-FSM-RTL-Vivado
This project implements an Elevator Controller using a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Verilog HDL. The design is developed and simulated using Xilinx Vivado, supporting multi-floor operation with controlled movement, door opening/closing logic, and synchronous state transitions, and is verified using a dedicated testbench and simulation waveforms.
